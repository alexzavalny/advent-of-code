Hi! My name is Alex Zavalny. 

2022 year is my first year I attend Advent of Code. This is huge fun. I implement everything in Ruby and try to make code compact but readable and simple.

Each day, after Gold star is honestly received, I go to reddit to look for interesting solutions. Sometimes I am so envy, that I steal some idea and add it to my code (leaving comment about it for future me).

Few solutions are translated from Ruby to JS or Rust via OpenGPT.
